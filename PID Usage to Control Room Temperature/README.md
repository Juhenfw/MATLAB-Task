# Temperature Control System Analysis

## Overview

This project presents a detailed analysis of a room temperature control system using MATLAB and Simulink. The system simulates how to maintain a desired temperature within a room by employing a feedback control loop. This analysis includes the design, simulation, and evaluation of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller, which adjusts the heating or cooling required to maintain the setpoint temperature.

## Key Features

- **Simulink Model Construction**: The code guides the construction of a Simulink model, including blocks like Step input, Sum, PID Controller, Transfer Function for the temperature control plant, and a Scope for visualizing results.
  
- **Realistic Parameter Setting**: The project defines and uses realistic parameters, such as thermal mass, specific heat capacity, and mass flow rate, to ensure the simulation closely represents a real-world scenario.

- **Temperature Control Simulation**: The system simulates the dynamic behavior of room temperature in response to various external and internal disturbances, helping to visualize how effectively the PID controller maintains the desired temperature.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB with Simulink installed.
- Basic understanding of control systems and MATLAB/Simulink environment.

### Running the Simulation

1. **Open the Simulink Model**: The script includes commands to create and open the Simulink model.
2. **Set Parameters**: Adjust the parameters in the script as needed for your specific analysis.
3. **Run the Simulation**: Execute the script in MATLAB to run the simulation.
4. **Analyze Results**: Use the Scope block in Simulink to visualize the temperature response over time.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the simulation, including:

- **Initial Conditions**: Set different initial temperatures.
- **Disturbances**: Introduce different external disturbances to see how the system responds.
- **Controller Tuning**: Experiment with different PID settings to optimize the control system.

## Applications

This simulation is ideal for:

- **Educational purposes**, to demonstrate the principles of PID control in temperature regulation.
- **Research and development**, providing a foundation for more complex HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) system simulations.
- **Testing different control strategies** in a simulated environment before implementation in real-world systems.
